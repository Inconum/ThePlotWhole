I'm not usually watching seasonals, and when I do it's not always while they are airing.
This is still not the definitive order, as I haven't watched all the shows yet, and will be updating this as I go through all of the series in this list.

# Watching

### [Dandadan 2nd Season](https://myanimelist.net/anime/60543/Dandadan_2nd_Season)
### [Watashi ga Koibito ni Nareru Wake Nai jan, Muri Muri! (※Muri ja Nakatta!?)](https://myanimelist.net/anime/60326/Watashi_ga_Koibito_ni_Nareru_Wake_Nai_jan_Muri_Muri_%E2%80%BBMuri_ja_Nakatta)
Sometimes I like my junk food. And this show was it for me this season. From the nonsensical and contrived plot, crafted with the single purpose of creating a harem for Renako, to the pop-culture and hikkikomori humor, this show hit all those boxes in my book. It is hard to recommend for people less accustomed to these ~degenerate~ self-depreciating kinds of shows, but I had a blast watching this. It managed a good balance of humor, romance and even actual character exploration and development to have me coming back each week for me, and that says more than a lot of shows out there.

### [Ame to Kimi to](https://myanimelist.net/anime/59619/Ame_to_Kimi_to)
This show has been a cozy companion on my daily life this season. It's very nice to have on in the background while I'm doing other tasks and it's heartwarming humor never failed to put a smile on my face.

### [City The Animation](https://myanimelist.net/anime/59898/City_The_Animation)
Just like Nichijou, the humor of City The Animation didn't really land for me. I felt like none of the jokes were particularly funny (most even less so than Nichijou), and some episodes (like episode 5) were straight up overstimulating, with multiple storylines happening at the same time. It felt like thos ADHD social media posts, where there's a section of the screen playing Subway Surfers while 3 other thigns happen at the same time. This overall package made for a very unsettling focused watching experience, but as a background anime it was way more bearable, so that's how I ended up watching it by the end.

### [Kaoru Hana wa Rin to Saku](https://myanimelist.net/anime/59845/Kaoru_Hana_wa_Rin_to_Saku)
This show is definetly pulling on my heart strings. Everyone is very sweet and I'm here for the sap.

### [Gachiakuta](https://myanimelist.net/anime/59062/Gachiakuta)
My curiosity was peaked by the tone and world building thats reminding me of Dorohedoro (one of my favorite manga). Only time will tell how it holds up, but for now I will keep my eyes open for more episodes.

### [Hikaru ga Shinda Natsu](https://myanimelist.net/anime/58913/Hikaru_ga_Shinda_Natsu)
This show has been one of the most anticipated of the week for this season. I have been blown away practically every episode with the cinematography and directing. This is my style of show in those aspects so it felt particularly catered towards my visual preferences. But this series also excels in other avenues, namely story and characters, which are both incredible. I was a bit reluctant about watching this at first because I am notoriously bad with horror media, but the more suspenseful presentation of Hikaru ga Shinda Natsu was good surprise for me. I would like to highllight episode 7, for its masterful building of tension, where even the most mundane of actions had me at the edge of my seat.
Part of this is in no small part due to incredibly human cast that show creates. Without going into too much detail, each character feels not only fleshed out but also layered, with beliefs and motivations that sometimes contradict each other, leading to very human actions and interactions.
I cannot recommend this series enough, specially for suspense and horror inclined viewers, or those in need of their doomed gay fix.

### [Dr. Stone: Science Future Part 2](https://myanimelist.net/anime/61322/Dr_Stone__Science_Future_Part_2)
### [Kaijuu 8-gou 2nd Season](https://myanimelist.net/anime/59177/Kaijuu_8-gou_2nd_Season)
### [New Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt](https://myanimelist.net/anime/52293/New_Panty___Stocking_with_Garterbelt)
This new season feels a lot less fresh than the original did 15 years ago. The "current day" commentary, in the same vein as South Park, was outdated even before it was penned (specially the ones about social media and influencer culture). It reads like a memoire and not like the general satire the first season had. I think this is in part because the first season was commenting on more broad "bitchy" topics, while this new one is forced to focus on specific topics (because they general ones were already convered in the original). Even the pop-culture references feel stale. One that stands out to me is the "Fast and Furious but they are actually semen" joke, which feels like a watered down version of the same joke the original made with a similar parody of "Saving Private Ryan". One positive aspect is the increased screentime of the devil sisters, but even they are slowly losing their luster fast.
Just like with the unecessary FLCL sequels, this also feels like an attempt at recapturing a labor of love series but with only half of the love and freedom that allowed for the creation of the original. Just like with FLCL, the original Panty and Stocking worked because it was what the staff wanted to do, regardless of the reception, while their respective sequels were only produced to try to reproduce the good reception that the original created. You cannot mass produce charisma and creative spark, just like you cannot just slap sexual humor and pop-culture references and call it Panty and Stocking. When one of the selling points of the show is tighly connected with the circunstances that lead to its production, it is hard to produce a satisfactory sequel. It is my stance that that same money would be better spend trying to recreate the circunstances for creative and bold original anime rather than a sad sad rehash of a cult classic. But alas, we live in a ~capitalist~ society.
