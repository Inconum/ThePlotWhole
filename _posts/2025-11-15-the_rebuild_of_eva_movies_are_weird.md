I have been an Evangelion fan for almost as long as I have been an anime fan, and that is going on 2 decades (wow I'm old), but I have always had mixed feelings about the rebuild movies.
I have watched the first two in anticipation for the release of 3.333 but then between that and the most recent installement I grew tired and fell off with the series a bit, never actually watching the 3.0+1.0 movie.
Recently, I rewatched these movies with someone that had only experienced the original TV anime over a decade ago, in preparation to finally watch the last entry and I was once again struck with mixed feelings that were best
described with a question my companion directed at me, the Eva authority in the room in their eyes: "So what was the point of all this? They keep starting instrumentality and never going through with it, destroying the planet
and killing a lot of people in the process, but nothing actually happens...". I had no answer to this question, not in the moment and not in the last 10 years of dealing with this exact same
feeling, so I will be writting this in order to maybe reach a conclusion.

This first half will be written before watching the last movie, because I want to capture and dissect my thoughts before "saying goodbye to all of evangelion", and the trailers and posters put it.
